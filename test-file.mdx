To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

## Line Breaks

This is the first line. And this is the second line.

## Emphasis

_This text will be italic_ _This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold** **This will also be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

## Unordered

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

## Ordered

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period,
you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.

## Adding Elements in Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list,
indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

### Paragraphs

- This is the first list item.
- Here's the second list item.

  I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

- And here's the third list item.

### Blockquotes

- This is the first list item.
- Here's the second list item.

  > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

- And here's the third list item.

## Inline Code

Here is some inline `code`

## CodeBlock

```javascript
// outer/global scope: RED

const heroes = [
  {id: 1, name: 'Batman', identity: 'Bruce Wayne'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Robin', identity: 'Dick Grayson'},
  {id: 3, name; 'Catwoman', identity: 'Selina Kyle'}
]

function getHeroName(heroID) {
  // function scope: BLUE

  for (let hero of heroes) {
    // LOOP SCOPE: GREEN

    if (hero.id === heroID) {
      return hero.name
    }
  }
}

const nextHero = getHeroName(1)

console.log(nextHero)
// Batman
```

## Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (\*\*\*), dashes (---),
or underscores (\_\_\_) on a line by themselves.

Asterisks:

---

Dashes

---

Underscores

---

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and
then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g.,
(https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle
brackets.

<https://www.markdownguide.org> <fake@example.com>

## Task Lists

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with
hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
